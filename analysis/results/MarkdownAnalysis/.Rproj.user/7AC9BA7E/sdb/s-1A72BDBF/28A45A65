When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.\n\n## Including Code\n\nYou can include R code in the document as follows:\n\n```{r cars}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",

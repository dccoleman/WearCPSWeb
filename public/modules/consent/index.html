<p class="placeholder">Responding to Safety and Security Notification Alerts
</p>

<p>Introduction: You are being asked to participate in a research study.  Before you agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your participation.  This form presents information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your participation.</p>
 
<p>Purpose of the study:  As technology progresses and continues to miniaturize, the healthcare sector is increasingly turning to Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) to provide real-time, more personalized, higher- quality treatment. Often the base station for WBANs is a mobile device, such as a smartphone or smartwatch. As these networks become more prevalent, so too will attempts to compromise and control them through attacks. The purpose of this study is to examine notification techniques that help people react to attacks they could experience on their WBAN.</p>
 
<p>Procedures to be followed:  You will be given a particular role of someone living with a WBAN at the beginning of the experiment. We’ll ask that you place yourself in the mindset of that individual as you proceed through the experiment. After being assigned a role you will be given an interactive task to complete that you will be scored on. During this interactive task you must also respond to alerts that will appear throughout the experiment. After a set amount of time the experiment will end and we’ll ask you some questions to help provide feedback for the experiment.</p>
 
<p>Risks to study participants:  Given the anonymous nature of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and the common nature of the task, there are no anticipated risks.</p>
 
<p>Benefits to research participants and others:  The possible benefits include helping to discover optimal ways to display information in notification-based alerts, particularly using smartwatches, to individuals about their WBANs.</p>

<p>Record keeping and confidentiality: Records of your participation in this study will be held confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study investigators, the sponsor or it’s designee and, under certain circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to this data.  Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify you by your Amazon ID.</p>
 
<p>Cost/Payment:  TBD/(This task is estimated to take less than 15 minutes.)</p>

<p>Your participation in this research is voluntary.  Your refusal to participate will not result in any penalty to you or any loss of benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled.  You may decide to stop participating in the research at any time without penalty or loss of other benefits.  The project investigators retain the right to cancel or postpone the experimental procedures at any time they see fit.</p>

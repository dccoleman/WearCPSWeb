		<div id='welcomeText'>
			 <p>In the new world of the Internet of Things (IoT), everything from your car to your refrigerator has a connection to the internet and can be controlled by many of your favorite internet-connected devices </p>

			 <p>In this study, you will be provided with a word-counting task to complete. This involves counting the number of times a particular word appears in a table. This will be further explained on the following page.</p>
			 
			 <p>For the purposes of this experiment, please imagine you have many IoT devices in your home including a home security system, toaster, fridge, and fire alarm system. You will recieve notifications within your browser giving you alerts relating to these devices as well as the computing device you are taking the study on.</p>

			 <p>Please respond to these notifications as though they were real.</p>

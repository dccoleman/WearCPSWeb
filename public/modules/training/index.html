			 <p>In this study, you will be provided with a primary task to complete. It is a fairly simple counting game. You will be presented with a table of words and asked to count how many times a certain word appears in the table. If you are correct, your score goes up. If you are incorrect or run out of time, your score will go down. There is a limit of 2 minutes on the entire test and a limit ranging from 45 to 20 seconds on each individual table.<br>Below is a sample of the game. Please play until you feel comfortable with how the game operates.</p><br><br>
